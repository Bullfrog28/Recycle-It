# Recycle-It
Often, recycling locations are not well mapped and documented, especially small trash-can sized bins in cities or on college campuses. This makes it hard to recycle materials when on the go. Recycle It is an app providing users with a map and accompanying directions to nearby recycling locations, including small bins, for materials of their choice. It also allows users to take a photo to send to our database (which is then shared to other users via our location pins) of recycling locations to independently verify the locations are current.
